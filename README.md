ThermalTake Riing Duo Trio plugin for SignalRGB

This plugin is based on a plugin provided by WhirlwindFX for the Riing Quad. The additions were based on research done by MoshiMoshi0 @ https://github.com/MoshiMoshi0/ttrgbplusapi/blob/master/controllers/riing-plus.md

The positioning and mapping are based on the Duo 14, but should work with the Duo 12 as they have the same number of LEDs and same positions.
There are also several positions for the Riing Duo 14 based on preferred accuracy.

The ring trio positioning is a guess purely on what the duo layout is and will likely need to be modified as I don't have one for testing. I made a second guess that can be commented on if needed.
